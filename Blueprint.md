### **1. Requirements Definition (Full)**

The **Requirements Definition** phase is the foundation of any successful project. It's where we identify and clearly define the objectives, scope, and features of our crypto wallet tracker bot. This phase ensures that all stakeholders, whether it's the team or the users, have a shared understanding of what the bot will do. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of this step:

---

#### **1.1 Identify Key Features**

In this step, we’ll list the primary functionalities that the bot will offer. Think of it as gathering the high-level requirements. For a crypto wallet tracker bot, some key features might include:

- **Multi-Blockchain Support**: The bot should be able to track wallets on multiple blockchains, such as Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, etc.
- **Real-Time Balance Updates**: Users should receive notifications about changes in their wallet balances as soon as they happen.
- **Price Alerts**: Users can set alerts for token prices and receive notifications when the price exceeds or drops below a certain threshold.
- **Transaction Alerts**: Notify users of any incoming or outgoing transactions.
- **Historical Data & Charts**: Users should be able to view historical data on their wallet performance, including charts showing token price trends and balance changes.
- **Cross-Platform**: Users can interact with the bot through multiple channels (Telegram, Discord, web interface, etc.).

---

#### **1.2 Define User Roles**

We need to define who will be using the bot and what permissions each user role will have. Examples of user roles for a crypto wallet tracker bot might be:

- **Admin**: Manages settings, handles user issues, and maintains the bot.
- **Regular User**: Can add their wallet addresses, set up alerts, and receive notifications.
- **Guest User**: May have limited functionality, like viewing wallet balances without setting alerts.

This step ensures that we account for how each user type will interact with the system and what functionalities they’ll need access to.

---

#### **1.3 Functional Requirements**

In this part, we dive deeper into how each feature will work. Functional requirements specify **what the system should do**. Some examples for our bot might include:

- **Add Wallets**: Users can input their wallet address and track their balances in real-time.
- **Set Price Alerts**: Users can set a price range for specific tokens. When the price crosses the threshold, a notification is triggered.
- **Transaction Tracking**: For each wallet, track incoming and outgoing transactions and notify the user immediately.
- **Cross-Blockchain Compatibility**: The bot should support major blockchain networks like Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and others.

Each functional requirement needs to be defined in a way that developers can later implement them.

---

#### **1.4 Non-Functional Requirements**

Non-functional requirements are the qualities and constraints that the system should have, such as performance, scalability, and security. These do not describe specific features but how the system should perform.

- **Performance**: The bot should be able to handle multiple simultaneous users and push notifications in real-time without significant delays.
- **Scalability**: The system should be scalable to support a growing number of users and wallets. It should handle a significant number of blockchain queries without affecting performance.
- **Security**: All sensitive information, such as wallet addresses and user credentials, must be encrypted. User authentication should follow industry best practices (e.g., OAuth2, JWT). No sensitive wallet private keys should be stored.
- **Usability**: The bot's user interface (UI) on the web and within Telegram/Discord should be user-friendly and simple to interact with.
- **Reliability**: The system should be highly reliable with minimum downtime. Notifications for price changes or transactions should be delivered accurately and promptly.

---

#### **1.5 Technical Requirements**

These are the technical aspects that we need to consider when building the project. These requirements will influence our choice of programming languages, frameworks, and other technologies. Some common technical requirements for a crypto wallet tracker bot include:

- **API Integrations**: The system should integrate with various blockchain APIs (e.g., Infura, Alchemy) to retrieve wallet information, token balances, and transaction histories.
- **Database**: We’ll need a database that supports fast lookups (e.g., for retrieving wallet histories) and can handle real-time data (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or similar).
- **Notification Services**: Services like Telegram Bot API, Discord Webhooks, email (SendGrid), and SMS (Twilio) will be used to send alerts to users.
- **Front-End Interface**: If building a web interface, the front-end should be designed using technologies like React.js or Vue.js for a modern, responsive UI.
- **Backend Services**: The bot backend should be able to interact with the blockchain through libraries like Web3.py or ethers.js.

---

#### **1.6 Business Requirements**

Business requirements tie the project to its broader goals and the impact it will have on users or stakeholders. For example:

- **User Growth**: The system should be able to support and onboard new users with ease.
- **Monetization**: If we plan to monetize the bot, we’ll need to think about subscription tiers or premium features (e.g., premium users get faster transaction alerts or more price-tracking options).
- **Compliance**: Ensure that the system complies with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR for handling user data in Europe).

---

#### **1.7 Constraints & Assumptions**

Identify any limitations or assumptions that could affect development. Some examples include:

- **Blockchain API limits**: The system may be limited by the rate limits imposed by blockchain API providers like Infura, which could affect the frequency of wallet balance updates.
- **User Limits**: If using a free tier of a cloud provider, there may be limits on how many users can simultaneously access the system.
- **Assumptions**: Assume that users will primarily track public wallet addresses, and sensitive private keys will never be handled by the bot.

---

### **Outcome of Requirements Definition**

By the end of this phase, we will have a clear, documented list of:

- What the crypto wallet tracker bot will do (features)
- Who will use the bot (user roles)
- How the bot should perform (functional and non-functional requirements)
- Any technical, business, and legal constraints

This phase is crucial as it provides the blueprint and sets the stage for the architectural and coding stages of the project.
